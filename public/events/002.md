# Karrakis // 3.02.5014u
The Claws of Karrakis were dispatched by BUC to investigate a research station that had gone dark. They arrived to find various anomalies related to parallel worlds or multiple timelines. While Gelsomino, Alara, and Jillian engaged with RPV mechs outside the station, Abdul entered and made contract with the cascading NHP Everett.

The situation ended with Everett vanishing with itself, Abdul, and the station. Abdul was found again shortly after, but in the gap had spent an indeterminate amount of nonlinear time in contact with Everett and some higher plane of existence.
