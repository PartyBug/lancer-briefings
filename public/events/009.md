# Karrakis // 5.01.5014u
The Claws of Karrakis tracked the remains of a Union cell to Argosy station, where they convinced them to give up the location of the Ungreatful insurgent Stargazer.

Following the trail, they raided an abandoned strip mine on Khayradin. They were able to put down the Ungreatfuls, as well as secure the body of Stargazer and keep him alive. He was taken to a prepared medical facility, later to be delivered to Lady Malia Igori.
