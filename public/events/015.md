The Claws engaged Harrison forces on Hadii (DS9). Gelsomino, using a prototype weapon sourced from his contacts, was able to do heavy damage to the formidble Herrison prototype weapon BIG ZOM. Efforts by the other Claws ensured that BIG ZOM was destroyed. Its pilot, codenamed Zompa, was recovered and recruited.
