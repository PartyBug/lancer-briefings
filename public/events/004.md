# Karrakis // 3.27.5014u
After Abdul rejoined the group after a brief sojurn to his homeworld, the Claws of Karrakis took a job he was given by his aunt, Lady Malia Igori. They were tasked with escorting an agent from the House of Sand and a captured defector back to Tilimsam.

After a brief stop to attempt to aprehend some Ungreatfuls--all of whom killed themselves rather than be captured--they met the Sand agent, Ash, on the moon of Arrudye. After a narrow escape from House of Moments authorities they travelled on to space station TS-06 orbiting the Sand homeworld. The group fended off another attack from unknown assailants, capturing one before returning to the station to await Lady Igori's arrival.
