Attending a viewing party for the latest round of the House Games, Gelsomino made contact with his 'uncle' Parzival Vebelle. The group agreed to take on a job to retrieve a machine mind that the House of Smoke was using to cheat in the Games. On their way out several subalterns at the party malfunctioned, attacking guests before being subdued. The ultimate cause was unknown, but the party recieved small thanks from the host, Lord Hildred March, before departing for their mission.

Storming a near-abandoned airstrip outside of the capital, the group destroyed several automated defenses before taking custody of the machine mind and making a hasty exit. They launched into orbit, heading into hiding until Parzival made the necessary prepertions to present the evidence.
