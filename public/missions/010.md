# Mission // #010
## Fury Road

Commander Hugo Palisade of the House of Stone requires the Claws of Karrakis to escort a convoy of supplies to a entrenched House Company fighting Harrison Armory forces on DS10. Due to heavy ordinance in the air, the Claws will be required to escort the convoy of supplies through the rugged mountain passes of the planet to reach their destination. Armory patrols are moving through the area, and combat should be expected if they move to intercept.

# Stakes
- Harrison Armory will maintain a foothold on DS10 if this mission is failed.
